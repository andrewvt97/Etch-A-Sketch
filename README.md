Drawing
https://andrewvt97.github.io/Etch-A-Sketch/

This is a drawing app that was built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The primary purpose of this app was to create
pixelated art, but it can be used to draw as well. There are four different modes for drawing. The first one is the 
regular color mode where the color is changed using the color picker. The next one is rainbow mode which generates a random color for every new div clicked, creating a rainbow effect. Then there is grayscale mode, which changes divs from white to black gradually, depending on the amount of times you go over it. Finally, there is erase mode which allows for erasing drawings. The grid color button gives you a different background color, and clear grid gets
rid of any drawings quickly. There is also an included pixel slider which changes the pixel size of the drawings.

The drawing is generated by changing divs when there is a click and hold event, on any of the divs. I hope you enjoy the app!
